This explains the basic shell navigation commands in this project

1-listit 
pwd - displays the current or present working directory. It displays the absolute path

2-bring_me_home 
cd ~
cd means change directory and ~ means home directory. Therefore, cd ~ means change directory to home directory

3-listfiles 
ls -l
ls means list the contents of the current directory
-l this attachment means give a long list or description of each subdirectories and files in the current directory

4-listmorefiles 
ls -a -l
-a this attachment means list everything including the hidden files and subdirectories
Therefore, ls -a -l means display the long lists of all the files and subdirectories including the hidden ones

5-listfilesdigitonly
ls -la
This command is the same as the one above in no.4 there is not difference in their output. It is simply telling us that we can put both -a and -l together and they will still do the same thing
